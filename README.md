Blotto Game Project Plan
Team Members
Person 1: Frontend Developer (UI/UX, Dash Components)
Person 2: Backend Developer (Game Logic, AI/Backend Integration)
Person 3: Data Scientist / Game Designer (AI Strategies, Game Balancing)
Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Structure (Week 1)
Goal: Set up basic project structure, initialize Dash app, and establish team collaboration practices.

Person 1 (Frontend Developer)
Tasks:
Set up Dash environment and create the initial app layout.
Create interactive components: sliders for resource allocation, buttons for submission.
Implement initial layout (resource allocation inputs, results display, and graph placeholders).
Set up responsive design (basic styling).
Person 2 (Backend Developer)
Tasks:
Set up project repository (GitHub) and initialize the Python environment.
Implement basic backend server with Flask for Dash.
Create helper functions to manage total resource tracking.
Integrate basic validation for the resource allocation (total â‰¤ available resources).
Person 3 (Game Designer / Data Scientist)
Tasks:
Design game rules: How the resources will be allocated across battlefields.
Create simple AI algorithm (random allocation strategy for AI opponent).
Define the structure for game results (e.g., win/loss/tie for each battlefield).
Milestone Deliverables
Project initialized and committed to GitHub.
Basic UI with resource allocation sliders.
Backend logic for total allocation tracking.
Simple AI opponent strategy.
Milestone 2: Resource Allocation Logic and Visuals (Week 2)
Goal: Implement the game logic, handle resource allocation, and visualize the results.

Person 1 (Frontend Developer)
Tasks:
Enhance UI with dynamic feedback (total resources displayed).
Implement bar chart (Plotly) to display resource allocation visually.
Add interactivity to the button to submit allocations.
Design a simple results page to show the outcome (winner of each battlefield, total points).
Person 2 (Backend Developer)
Tasks:
Implement backend game logic to compare allocations (player vs. AI).
Calculate the winner of each battlefield.
Implement backend validation to ensure no player allocates more resources than available.
Person 3 (Game Designer / Data Scientist)
Tasks:
Develop game outcome calculation logic (player vs. AI).
Implement AI strategy (for example: weighted or adaptive strategy).
Adjust AI to allocate resources based on battlefield importance (e.g., allocate more resources to specific battlefields).
Milestone Deliverables
UI updated to reflect real-time total resource allocation.
Game results displayed after submission.
AI opponent with a basic allocation strategy.
Game logic implemented for winner determination.
Milestone 3: Polishing and Additional Features (Week 3)
Goal: Refine the game mechanics, improve AI strategy, and polish UI/UX.

Person 1 (Frontend Developer)
Tasks:
Refine UI/UX design (improve styling, use CSS for clean layouts).
Add feedback for the user (e.g., error messages if resources exceed total).
Implement a round timer for the game and countdown functionality.
Make the UI responsive across devices.
Person 2 (Backend Developer)
Tasks:
Optimize backend logic for smoother gameplay.
Implement multiplayer functionality (if applicable).
Refine the result display to show detailed game breakdown (e.g., battlefield-by-battlefield results).
Person 3 (Game Designer / Data Scientist)
Tasks:
Implement a more advanced AI strategy based on previous player rounds (adaptive learning or evolving strategy).
Balance the game by adjusting the number of battlefields or resource limits.
Add custom features like bonus points for specific battlefields or penalties for unused resources.
Milestone Deliverables
Refined game UI.
Enhanced backend features for multiplayer (if applicable).
Advanced AI opponent with adaptive behavior.
Polished, functional Blotto game with clear instructions.
Milestone 4: Testing, Deployment, and Documentation (Week 4)
Goal: Test the game for bugs, finalize the deployment, and complete documentation.

Person 1 (Frontend Developer)
Tasks:
Conduct UI testing and refine based on feedback.
Ensure responsiveness on mobile and different browsers.
Assist with deployment (cloud, Docker, or Heroku).
Person 2 (Backend Developer)
Tasks:
Perform backend tests (e.g., test game logic under different scenarios).
Implement logging for errors or issues.
Ensure data integrity and handle edge cases.
Person 3 (Game Designer / Data Scientist)
Tasks:
Perform balance testing on the AI and game mechanics.
Create a README file with detailed instructions on how to play and run the game.
Record potential issues or edge cases encountered during testing.
Milestone Deliverables
Game deployed on a platform like Heroku or AWS.
Documentation (README.md) with setup instructions, gameplay instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
Testing feedback collected and issues resolved.
